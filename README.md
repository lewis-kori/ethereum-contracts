# about this repository

The repo contains a collection of smart contracts I implemented while learning
and understanding blockchain programming, specifically the ethereum network.
The primary language used to implement the smart contracts is [solidity](https://soliditylang.org/)

## projects description

### Auction

The auction smart contract implements an auction functionality similar to ebay's auctions.

### Crowdfund

The Crowdfund smart contract mirrors kickstarter functionality.
A full-stack web app version of this can be found [in this repository](https://github.com/lewis-kori/web3-kickstarter).

### Coin

The coin smart contract implements a fully compliant [ERC20 token](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/).

### ICO

The ICO smart contract implements an initial coin offering for the [ERC20 coin](#Coin).

#### how to run the contracts

The easiest way to run the smart contracts is by copying them onto the remix IDE which is an online IDE highly optimized for solidity.

You can also clone the code to your local machine and run from a text editor/editor.

Make sure to have a local eth environment installed such as [hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) or [ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache).
